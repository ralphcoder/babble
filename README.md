## Discription

 I have implemented firebase 🔥**Authentication** to authenticate the user on login and signup.
 
 and firebase 🔥**Firestore** to make NoSQL document database that lets you easily store, sync, and query data.
 
 All the people logining in can have a group chat.👨‍👦‍👦

 App is made simple,and with good UI.
