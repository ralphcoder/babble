## Discription

 I have implemented firebase 🔥 **Authentication** to authenticate the user on login and signup.
 
 Firebase 🔥 **Firestore** to make NoSQL document database that lets us easily store, sync, and query data of the cit chats.🗣
 
 All the people logining in can have a group chat.👨‍👦‍👦

 App is made simple,and with good UI.🙂
